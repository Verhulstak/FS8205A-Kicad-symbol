# FS8205A-Kicad-symbol
A symbol for the FS8205A ic 
---
This ic is used in the TP4056 module, perticularly in the ones with protection.  
I was rebuilding this module for a project (PiPro) to a pcb and couldent find a correct symbol for kicad so i made my own.  
This is completly free to use, because I dont really care, took me like 5 minutes and if it helpes someone ill share it.  

Have a nice day and good luck with your project :)
